            <p className="text-[13px] p-2 md:p-5 text-start">
                The Winter Donation web application is dedicated to helping vulnerable communities in Bangladesh stay warm during the harsh winter months. Many underprivileged individuals, especially in rural and low-income areas, struggle to find adequate clothing to protect themselves from the cold. Our platform bridges the gap between generous donors and dedicated volunteers, ensuring that warm clothing reaches those who need it the most.
